        <p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Does the Republican Party have a death wish?</p>
    
        <p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Its most prominent leaders — particularly President Trump and Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader — have dug themselves into positions that defy all conventional rules of electoral survival. In an election year, even ideologically extreme politicians should try to do popular things and avoid doing unpopular things — if for no other reason than so that they can resume pursuing their extreme goals after Election Day.</p>
    
        <p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Instead, top Republicans in Washington are pulling out all the stops to do <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">unpopular</em> things and avoid doing <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">popular</em> things. Their main proposals — more tax cuts for the rich, corporate <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/geoffgarin/status/1258099461768843266" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">legal immunity</a>, pushing the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://apwu.org/news/new-poll-shows-two-thirds-public-supports-stimulus-funding-us-postal-service-only-15-percent" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">post office</a> into bankruptcy — have strikingly little support among voters, even among Republican voters. Meanwhile, they are resisting <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.people-press.org/2020/04/21/positive-economic-views-plummet-support-for-government-aid-crosses-party-lines/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">highly popular measures</a>, such as additional <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/geoffgarin/status/1260658633550880768" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">relief</a> for states, localities and ordinary workers, that would almost certainly increase their likelihood of holding onto power this fall.</p>
    
        <p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">This situation isn’t just surreal. It’s genuinely scary. In a democracy, leaders of a governing party shouldn’t act as if they can brazenly defy large majorities of voters and still hold onto power. The alarm bells only get louder when you begin to examine why current Republican leaders think this way — and why they might be right.</p>
    
        <p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The United States is a profoundly polarized nation. Yet despite angry protests on the far right, the pandemic has actually lessened the divide among American voters. Large bipartisan majorities favor much more <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/geoffgarin/status/1260658633550880768" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">aid</a> to states, localities and workers; believe the federal government has <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.people-press.org/2020/05/12/most-americans-say-federal-government-has-primary-responsibility-for-covid-19-testing/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">primary responsibility</a> for ensuring adequate Covid-19 testing; and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/05/07/americans-remain-concerned-that-states-will-lift-restrictions-too-quickly-but-partisan-differences-widen/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">support</a> a cautious reopening of the economy guided by public health expertise.</p>
    
        <p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">By contrast, large bipartisan majorities oppose states having to declare bankruptcy; the post office going insolvent; helping out corporate executives, the wealthy and big business with bailouts and other <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/nickgourevitch/status/1258727001642487808" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">special deals</a>; states handling testing on their own or a quick reopening without robust safeguards.</p>
    
        <p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Rather than celebrating and heeding this unusual convergence, top Republicans in Washington have snubbed it. They have rejected what bipartisan majorities demand and demanded what bipartisan majorities reject. And they’ve done so knowing that voters will soon get their say.</p>
    
        <p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">In a few cases, they may believe voters will eventually move toward the party’s stances. In others, they may be posturing so Democrats have to yield costly concessions. And yet, as the stalemate wears on, it becomes harder and harder to avoid the simplest explanation for Republicans’ poisonous positions: They are devoted to them, and they think they can get away with them.</p>
    
        <p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Their devotion may be shocking, but it really shouldn’t be surprising. Since the 1990s, Republicans have increasingly embraced the most extreme goals of the party’s corporate and big-money supporters. In 2017, Republican leaders advanced an agenda that managed to feature the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/cwarshaw/status/931571451001561089" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">two most unpopular pieces of major legislation</a> of the past quarter century: repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act and big, deficit-funded tax cuts for corporations and the rich. The former barely failed. The latter narrowly passed after Republican donors <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://publicintegrity.org/inequality-poverty-opportunity/taxes/trumps-tax-cuts/did-billionaires-pay-off-republicans-for-passing-the-trump-tax-bill/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">made clear</a> that, if the party didn’t deliver, the funding spigot would run dry.</p>
    
        <p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">As the official death toll from Covid-19 passes 100,000, these plutocratic priorities look even more glaring. Amid a crisis that’s laid bare American inequality, Republicans’ first instinct has remained the same: to go to the mat for the superrich. They’ve twisted relief bills to provide unrelated tax cuts and no-strings bailouts, shuttered the Senate amid a national health and economic crisis (though opened it long enough to strong-arm conservative judges onto the bench) and continued to float toxic ideas in an election year — say, making people give up some of their Social Security benefits in return for a financial lifeline today. If there’s an idea popular among conservative billionaires and nobody else, Republicans are probably pushing for it now.</p>
    
        <p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">But if Republicans lose big in the fall, then those who benefit from their consistent embrace of plutocracy lose, too. Why do Republicans and their organized allies think they can get away with it — or at least have a good enough chance to justify the risk?</p>
    
        <p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The answer offers a stark warning about American democracy. Republicans benefit from two formidable bulwarks against electoral accountability. The first is tribalism: Republican elites have <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/11/newt-gingrich-says-youre-welcome/570832/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">encouraged</a> their high-turnout voting base to see every election as an epic battle to save white Christian America from a socialist, secular, gun-seizing left, with right-wing media and surrogate groups like the N.R.A. leading the charge.</p>
    
        <p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The second bulwark isn’t solely of Republicans’ creation. Our political system guarantees less populated areas outsize clout in the Senate and gives control over election administration to the states. Republicans have built a growing advantage in rural America over the past two decades. The result is that the Senate (and, to a lesser extent, the Electoral College) remains a counter-majoritarian stronghold — not invulnerable to electoral reversal but highly resistant to it.</p>
    
        <p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">At the same time, Republicans in red states have used partisan gerrymandering and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/new-voter-suppression" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">voter restrictions</a> to disadvantage citizens outside their base. The latter include voter ID laws, the indiscriminate purging of the voter rolls and rules that make it harder to register, get to the polls, vote early and (especially crucial now) vote remotely. In the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/24/politics/republican-national-committee-california-vote-by-mail-lawsuit/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">latest move</a>, the Republican National Committee and other Republican groups sued California to stop the state from mailing all registered voters absentee ballots for the fall election. Besides being fundamentally at odds with democratic equality, all these efforts further undermine electoral accountability.</p>
    
        <p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">In the pandemic, these strategies have become much more dangerous. If Republicans stick to their unpopular positions, they will have to build their twin bulwarks even higher to escape accountability, magnifying racial and cultural divisions and undermining free and fair elections in ways that threaten not just the health of citizens but the health of our democracy</p>
    
        <p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Republicans could end up losing, despite all this. But their determination to defy the most basic law of electoral gravity — that you respond to the pull of voters as an election approaches — should set off a blaring alarm. In the midst of a health and economic catastrophe, they are putting their dangerous indifference to popular sentiment to the ultimate test.</p>

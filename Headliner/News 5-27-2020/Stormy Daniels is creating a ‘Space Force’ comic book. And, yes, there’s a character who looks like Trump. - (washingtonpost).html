    <h1>Stormy Daniels is creating a ‘Space Force’ comic book. And, yes, there’s a character who looks like Trump.</h1>

        <p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md">Stormy Daniels is going to space — at least in cartoon form.</p>
    
        <p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md">Daniels, the adult-film actress who <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/01/08/stormy-daniels-suggests-counter-programming-trumps-address-its-her-her-underwear/?itid=lk_inline_manual_3" target="_blank">says she had an affair</a> with Donald Trump, is co-creating the comic-book series “Stormy Daniels: Space Force” with Darren G. Davis and TidalWave Productions, the Vancouver, Wash.-based publisher announced Tuesday.</p>
    
        <p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md">In the comic, Capt. Stormy Daniels commands a for-hire starship as the United Republic of Earth is led by OrDon, who is rendered with an orange hue. TidalWave calls the series, which apparently is not for young children, “Barbarella-meets-Star Trek-meets-Stripperella<i>.” </i></p>
    
        <p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md">The series is set to launch this fall, scripted by Michael Frizell and Andrew Shayde (best known for “Amazing Race”) and drawn by Pablo Martinena, with featured covers by Bill Walko and Agung Prabowo.</p>
    
        <p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md">An animated show led by the Bohemia Group is also in development, TidalWave says.</p>
    
        <p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md">TidalWave previously created a comic book titled “Female Force: Stormy Daniels,” which told the story of her path as an adult-entertainment performer, beginning in Baton Rouge clubs. Davis says that he met Daniels in February at a Tacoma, Wash., comedy show and that they talked about collaborating further.</p>
    
        <p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md">“She has a lot of ideas, and she is so funny, and I love her wit,” Davis told The Washington Post on Tuesday, noting that the project will include the release of action figures.</p>
    
        <p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md">“TidalWave has been so generous with allowing my input,” Daniels said in a statement.</p>
    
        <p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md">Last week, Michael Cohen, a former attorney for President Trump, was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/michael-cohen-released-from-federal-prison-over-coronavirus-concerns/2020/05/21/21660620-96ca-11ea-91d7-cf4423d47683_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_13" target="_blank">released from prison</a> because of coronavirus concerns. Cohen <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trumps-longtime-lawyer-michael-cohen-is-in-plea-discussions-with-federal-prosecutors-according-to-a-person-familiar-with-the-matter/2018/08/21/5fbd7f34-8510-11e8-8553-a3ce89036c78_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_32&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_13" target="_blank">entered a guilty plea</a> in 2018, saying in part that he arranged to pay off two women to not tell their stories of alleged affairs with Trump before the presidential election. As The Post reported at the time, the details Cohen described “matched payments made to former Playboy model Karen McDougal and adult-film star Stormy Daniels.”</p>
    
        <p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md">TidalWave announced the comic as Trump is moving forward on plans for his real-life Space Force, a new branch of the military. This month, he unveiled the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/trump-unveils-space-force-flag/2020/05/15/2c56a2b6-e2ec-4b05-a571-7c4bb55ea034_video.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_15" target="_blank">Space Force flag</a>, featuring a logo that some observers have said visually quotes Star Trek.</p>

    <h1>A Stranger’s Gift to an I.C.U. Nurse: A Free N.Y.C. Apartment</h1>
    
        <p>Advertisement</p>
    
        <p>New Yorkers who have fled the city are donating their empty homes to front-line workers and others in need.</p>
    
        <p>By Alyson Krueger</p>
    
        <p>Around noon on Easter Sunday, Leona Hernandez, a registered nurse, pulled up in a van to a stranger’s home on the South Side of Minneapolis.</p>
    
        <p>Her children, ages 2, 4 and 6, were with her. One asked, “Mom, is this New York?”</p>
    
        <p>It was not. But it was the temporary home of a New Yorker, who gave Ms. Hernandez, a resident of nearby St. Paul, Minn., the keys to her Manhattan apartment, along with some instructions.</p>
    
        <p>Two days later, Ms. Hernandez left Minnesota, apartment keys in hand, to work with coronavirus patients in the intensive care unit of a major New York City hospital.</p>
    
        <p>Hannah Cairns, the New Yorker, said she was thrilled to donate her apartment to an I.C.U. nurse. A few weeks before the key handoff, she had arrived in Minneapolis to crash on her father’s sofa for the duration of the outbreak. A work colleague then told her about Ms. Hernandez.</p>
    
        <p>“The opportunity kind of fell into my lap, and it was a no-brainer,” said Ms. Cairns, 28, who works in sales and lives in the East Village.</p>
    
        <p>“She tried to offer me funds,” Ms. Cairns said. “I said, ‘Absolutely not.’ This was an angel of a human.”</p>
    
        <p>Across the city, New Yorkers who have fled are donating their apartments to out-of-town medical workers or to locals with health conditions that can make them more vulnerable to the virus. Several people who have left said they felt guilty about not being in the city to clap for health care workers or to order takeout in support of their favorite restaurants. Sharing their empty homes provides a substantial way to pitch in.</p>
    
        <p>For the recipients, the apartments provide a home away from home, a place to help them feel more comfortable.</p>
    
        <p>“This might sound silly, but it lifts my spirits just to know I am here, because it means someone is willing to help a complete stranger,” Ms. Hernandez, 33, said. “It helps me feel a little less alone.”</p>
    
        <p>She is slowly adjusting to the East Village. The diminutive, two-room walk-up is much smaller than her free-standing house, which has a yard. There is hardly any counter space, and there is “a lovely coffee table, but no table table,” Ms. Hernandez said.</p>
    
        <p>She is also getting used to life in New York during a pandemic. “I went on a long walk to Times Square, and I bought toilet paper,” Ms. Hernandez said. “I was like, ‘Never have I walked two miles holding toilet paper,’ but I saw four other people doing the same thing, so I realized that’s just what people do here. I feel like a New Yorker.”</p>
    
        <p>Mei Ann Teo, 41, the producing artistic director for Musical Theatre Factory, usually lives in a 400-square-foot apartment in Manhattan’s Greenwich Village that she describes as “cozy.” In late March, she took a last-minute flight to Singapore, where her parents were hospitalized with the coronavirus. Before she left, she made sure that her empty apartment would go to someone in need of a private space: Rainey Rowan.</p>
    
        <p>Ms. Rowan, 32, a friend of a friend, was undergoing chemotherapy for Stage 2 breast cancer at the time. An operations manager at Town Stages, an arts space in TriBeCa, she had been living with two roommates in Astoria, Queens, and had become anxious about her situation.</p>
    
        <p>“There’s a rotating cast of caretakers, boxes of medical supplies, emotional turbulence to navigate, and I’m not as capable of handling my share of apartment chores,” Ms. Rowan said. “When I first heard about Mei Ann’s apartment, my jaw hit the floor.”</p>
    
        <p>The timing proved fortunate: Ms. Rowan is scheduled to have a mastectomy on Tuesday, and her mother is coming to town to help her recover. “It’s like I am being given this incredible gift right at the moment when I need it the most,” Ms. Rowan said.</p>
    
        <p>Other New Yorkers want to donate their apartments, but say are unable to find a taker.</p>
    
        <p>Jordi Lippe-McGraw, a travel journalist who fled the city, posted on multiple Facebook groups that her one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan was available. “You feel guilty,” Ms. Lippe-McGraw, 33, said. “You feel helpless. I just wanted to do something.”</p>
    
        <p>She quickly received multiple responses, but none of them panned out. There were scheduling issues, or the virus sickened potential guests.</p>
    
        <p>New Yorkers who manage to donate their apartments to medical workers or those in need risk pushback from landlords or neighbors. The workers are essentially guests who are not subletting, but they are potentially exposing other residents to the virus.</p>
    
        <p>Ms. Cairns told her superintendent about Ms. Hernandez’s stay, but not her landlord.</p>
    
        <p>“My main concern is that I could risk eviction for hosting an I.C.U. nurse or more generally having a visitor for a long stay,” she said. Because the virus is believed to remain on surfaces for only a few days, she said that she was not worried about getting infected in the apartment upon her return.</p>
    
        <p>Ms. Teo was concerned about infecting her guest, Ms. Rowan. “I was more worried that I might be asymptomatic and leave the virus for someone with compromised immunity,” she said. “So I cleaned like I’ve never cleaned before.”</p>
    
        <p>Also tricky is the fact that New Yorkers who left the city might want to return soon.</p>
    
        <p>Ms. Hernandez told Ms. Cairns that she would move out immediately if she wanted to come back.</p>
    
        <p>“Stay as long as you need,” Ms. Cairns told Ms. Hernandez. “If I come back early, I will stay with friends.”</p>

        <p>If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.</p>
    
        <p>This is a difficult question, because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report, Scott Gottlieb, Caitlin Rivers, Mark B. McClellan, Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization, without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days.</p>
    
        <p>The Times Neediest Cases Fund has started a special campaign to help those who have been affected, which accepts donations here. Charity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30,000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal, though.)</p>
    
        <p>The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing.</p>
    
        <p>If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic, for instance — you won’t be able to get tested.</p>
    
        <p>It seems to spread very easily from person to person, especially in homes, hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face.</p>
    
        <p>No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away.</p>
    
        <p>Unlike the flu, there is no known treatment or vaccine, and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu, but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard.</p>
    
        <p>If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home, you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms, while also keeping as much distance as possible, according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space, the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available, both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters, doorknobs, toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently.</p>
    
        <p>Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves, the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home.</p>
    
        <p>Yes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.</p>
    
        <p>That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired, having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation, or even grows, makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years.</p>
    
        <p>Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions, make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.”</p>

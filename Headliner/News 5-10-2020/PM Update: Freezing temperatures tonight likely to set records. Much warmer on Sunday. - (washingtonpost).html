        <p>7:20 p.m. - Record cold highs set across the region</p>
    
        <p>High temperatures across the region only rose into the low 50s today, setting records for the coldest highs on record for the date at all three airports. Here are the details:</p>
    
        <p>The high of 52 at National marked the coldest high temperature in May since May 12, 2008, when the high was also 52. You have to go back to May 1, 1963 when it was 51 for a colder high.</p>
    
        <p>Detailed forecast</p>
    
        <p>It is officially May 9, but it sure doesn’t feel like it. Record low temperatures (more on that above and below) were set across the region, part of a flurry of record cold and late-season snowfall observed across the eastern U.S. on Saturday. Temperatures will be a few degrees colder tonight, prompting regionwide frost and freeze advisories through Sunday morning. The good news is that by Sunday afternoon, temperatures in the mid-60s will have it feeling like a regular spring day again.</p>

        <p>Through tonight: Gusty winds should taper off after dark, and skies will become mostly clear overnight. That sets the stage for another very cold night for May, with low temperatures west of Interstate 95 dropping to around 29 to 32 degrees. D.C. and points east will bottom out in the 32-36 degree range. Widespread frost is likely in the predawn hours except perhaps downtown and near the Potomac River and Chesapeake Bay.</p>

        <p>Rick Steves is a travel evangelist, always in motion, traversing faraway places and inspiring others to do the same. So when the world shuts down, and Rick Steves can no longer travel, then who is Rick Steves?</p>
    
        <p>Sam Anderson, a writer for The Times Magazine, profiled the travel guru last year. Today, Sam asks Rick how he’s been expanding his horizons from home. Dreaming of travel, we learn, is nearly as sweet as the real thing.</p>
    
        <p>On today’s episode:</p>
    
        <p>Sam Anderson, a staff writer at The New York Times Magazine.</p>
    
        <p>Rick Steves, the author of dozens of travel guidebooks and host of “Rick Steves’ Europe,” the public-television travel series.</p>

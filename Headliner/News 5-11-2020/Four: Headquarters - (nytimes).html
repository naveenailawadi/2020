        <p>Background reading:</p>
    
        <p>When Ms. Wojcicki became the C.E.O. of YouTube in 2014, she “inherited an audacious goal: Get users to watch more than one billion hours of videos every day,” the Times reporter Daisuke Wakabayashi writes in his profile of the C.E.O. “But somewhere along the line, her job became less about growth and more about toxic containment.”</p>

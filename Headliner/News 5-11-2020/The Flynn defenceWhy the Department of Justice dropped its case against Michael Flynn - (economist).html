    <h1>The Flynn defenceWhy the Department of Justice dropped its case against Michael Flynn</h1>
    
        <p>He had already pleaded guilty in the Robert Mueller investigation into Russian interference</p>
    
        <p>WASHINGTON, DC</p>
    
        <p>ON DECEMBER 1ST 2017 Michael Flynn, one of Donald Trump’s earliest supporters and his first national security adviser, pleaded guilty to lying to federal investigators. “I recognise that the actions I acknowledged in court today were wrong,” he told the court. “I accept full responsibility for my actions.” These included making “materially false statements” that impeded the investigation into Russian interference in America’s presidential election of 2016. The retired lieutenant-general had lied about two separate matters: the nature of his conversations with Russia’s ambassador before Mr Trump took office, and the extent of his lobbying for the Turkish government.</p>
    
        <p>Mr Flynn was the second person to plead guilty in Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian meddling. At first, Mr Flynn co-operated with prosecutors, who in return recommended a light sentence. But in the middle of last year he hired a new lawyer and changed tack. His lawyer now argued that prosecutors acting in bad faith had sandbagged him, and the case against him should be dismissed due to “egregious government misconduct”. Mr Flynn sought to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>
    
        <p>Mr Flynn seemed to be angling for a presidential pardon, which in March of this year Mr Trump said he was “strongly considering”. Presidential-pardon powers are unfettered; even so, most frown on the sort of nakedly political pardon that Mr Flynn’s would have been. But on May 7th the pardon question became moot: the Justice Department summarily dropped the case against Mr Flynn. Many saw it as William Barr, the attorney-general, currying favour with his boss. That is only part of the story.</p>
    
        <p>Mr Barr called the decision to drop Mr Flynn’s prosecution “easy”. He believed the underlying investigation against Mr Flynn was illegitimate, and that his lies were therefore immaterial. He also derided the FBI’s tactics, accusing a former FBI director, James Comey, of “purposely [going] around the Justice Department”, and investigators of having laid “a perjury trap for General Flynn”.</p>
    
        <p>Documents unsealed in March show an investigator asking, in notes, “What’s urgent? Truth/admission or to get him to lie, so we can prosecute him or get him fired.” To Mr Flynn’s supporters, that document evinces entrapment. Another reading of the notes is that they merely show a lawyer asking questions about strategy. As a rule, lawyers try to maximise leverage to win; stripped of context, as these heavily redacted documents are, it may look damning, but it is the nature of an adversarial system. Defence lawyers often complain about perjury traps, but such complaints have rarely, if ever, succeeded in court.</p>
    
        <p>The Justice Department’s recent arguments discount what Mr Flynn had admitted he had done. Mr Flynn pleaded guilty, the government argues, “without cause to dispute it insofar as it concerned not his course of conduct but rather that of the agency investigating him, and insofar as it has been further illuminated by new information in discovery.” If that argument is hard to follow, it may be deliberate. The statement seems to mean Mr Flynn pleaded guilty to material deceit because the government said it was material, without full awareness of everything the government knew about him.</p>
    
        <p>“Evidentiary problems that have emerged create reasonable doubt” regarding the charges against Mr Flynn, said the Justice Department’s filing, an argument that defence attorneys make routinely. Consequently, “the government has concluded that the evidence is insufficient to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt”—despite the defendant having pleaded guilty to the thing he was charged with.</p>
    
        <p>The filing is signed by Timothy Shea, a close adviser to Mr Barr now serving as the top federal prosecutor in Washington, DC. Brandon Van Grack, the lawyer who had been prosecuting the case, withdrew suddenly shortly before the filing. A judge still has to approve the Justice Department’s actions, but once that hurdle is cleared, Mr Flynn has a glide path back to the top: Mike Pence, the vice-president, said he would be “happy to see Michael Flynn again”, and Mr Trump said he would “certainly consider” bringing him back into the administration.</p>
    
        <p>If the decision to drop the case against Mr Flynn were part of a broader reversal of Justice Department policy, in which prosecutors decline to seek maximum penalties and scrupulously police themselves for overreach, then it might be cause for cheer. But that is not the case: earlier this year, before an audience of county sheriffs, Mr Barr blasted reformist prosecutors who “are refusing to enforce entire categories of law”. Such policies put “everyone in danger”, “strike at the very root of our law enforcement system” and “lead to greater criminality”. Prosecutors need to maximally enforce laws against petty crime because that prevents violent crime.</p>
    
        <p>What is Mr Barr doing, then? He obtained his post after writing a long, unsolicited memo to Rod Rosenstein, then the deputy attorney-general, about Robert Mueller’s investigation. In it, he makes several odd assumptions about what Mr Mueller was investigating. He argues that federal lawyers, including the attorney-general, are presidential “subordinates”—“merely his hand”—and that all of their actions are subject to his approval. Presidential authority over federal law enforcement is “illimitable”, and therefore investigations into whether he obstructed justice by “exercis[ing] supervisory authority over cases in which his own conduct might be at issue” are inherently illegitimate.</p>
    
        <p>While serving as George H.W. Bush’s attorney-general, he argued that people in the Iran-Contra affair had been treated very unfairly. As Mr Trump’s attorney-general, he has referred to the probe into Russian electoral interference as “one of the greatest travesties in American history”.</p>
    
        <p>He has since been on a quest to undo it, arguing that the entire investigation was “without any basis”. Mr Barr assigned John Durham, a seasoned prosecutor, to investigate its origins. His Department of Justice has also intervened to press for a lighter sentence for Roger Stone, another Trump campaign hanger-on, who has been convicted of lying to Congress, witness tampering and obstruction of justice.</p>
    
        <p>When he says the investigation was “without any basis”, he means this in the legal sense, deploying his own circular argument: because the Department of Justice works for the president it cannot investigate him, and its probe is therefore baseless. In the ordinary sense of the term there was plenty of basis for the investigation, as detailed in Mr Mueller’s report. The efforts undertaken by Russian intelligence on a presidential candidate’s behalf, and the complex web of connections between a major-party presidential campaign and a foreign adversary really did happen. By downplaying the probe’s justification and undoing punishments for people caught lying to federal investigators, Mr Barr’s actions suggest a repeat performance would be treated lightly.</p>

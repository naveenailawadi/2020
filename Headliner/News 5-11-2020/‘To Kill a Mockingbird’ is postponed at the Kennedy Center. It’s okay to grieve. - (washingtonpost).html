    <h1>‘To Kill a Mockingbird’ is postponed at the Kennedy Center. It’s okay to grieve.</h1>
    
        <p>The news was not unexpected, just another of the disappointing notices filling my inbox day after day. But an outsize mournfulness descended on me with the announcement on Monday that “To Kill a Mockingbird” will not be coming to the Kennedy Center in August.</p>
    
        <p>It was to be the launch of the national tour of Aaron Sorkin’s fiercely theatrical and deeply moving Broadway adaptation of the Harper Lee novel, a book as close to a required text as exists on the shelf of American consciousness. Richard Thomas was to assume the role of Atticus Finch, a character of such admirable moral fiber and misguided faith in his fellow citizens that audiences come to look on him as the best part of their own flawed natures.</p>
    
        <p>Slated to start Aug. 25 and run through Sept. 27, the production schedule is now  without a script. Its booking office might as well be a virologist’s lab; the shot in the arm it needs will not be coming from a review — not at first, anyway.</p>
    
        <p>“Due to current events,” the arts center’s statement reads, “the play’s producers have decided to postpone the highly anticipated Kennedy Center run, and new details will be announced soon.” (Refunds, exchanges or donations of ticket purchases can be arranged.)</p>
    
        <p>Words to this effect should be numbing by now. Over the weekend, the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, one of the country’s great regional theaters, revealed that barring some dramatic change, it will not reopen until next March at the earliest, with a mini-season of three plays. Its budget is being slashed by more than half, with layoffs to come. “I have a sobering update to share,” is how Artistic Director Joseph Haj began his letter, addressed to his colleagues and subsequently released to the press.</p>
    
        <p>Theaters are formulating survival plans, and playwrights and actors and directors are dreaming up digital projects. But as we egg them on — and wonder how some of them will eat —  we also must be allowed to grieve. Theater is a here-today-gone-tomorrow kind of experience, a form that dwells wholly in the moment. As edifying as the bound volume of a play can be, without a living present, a play ceases to be. Lovers of being in the room with a play are floating in this state of protracted absence, a condition that is indeed sobering.</p>

        <p>And saddening. Maybe because I have had a particularly rewarding relationship with this iteration of “To Kill a Mockingbird,” the “postponement” has hit me especially hard. Since reviewing it for its Broadway opening in December 2018, I have chronicled its hit-status impact in multiple articles: followed it to Washington, where House Speaker Nancy Pelosi invited the cast to perform at the Library of Congress; talked to Sorkin and original star, Jeff Daniels; wrote about the actors playing its most reprehensible characters, and a deaf actor cast in two hearing roles.</p>
    
        <p>Most inspirationally, there was “Mockingbird’s” crowning achievement: the free performance at Madison Square Garden for 18,000 New York City middle and high school students and their teachers. What that event underlined was the power the play could have for younger audiences, and the opportunity it created for the issues that “Mockingbird” raises. At a moment at which political and racial divisions in the nation are becoming ever more entrenched, the play opened avenues for dialogue, a channel through which frustration and anguish might be vented.</p>
    
        <p>Alas, the virus muffled the exhilaration reverb of the Garden performance, which took place on Feb. 26. Fifteen days later, covid-19 would shut down Broadway and the event’s momentum dissipated.</p>
    
        <p>Whether or not one has reservations about the source material — and there are some who take issue with Lee’s paternalistic racial politics — the achievement of Sorkin and director Bartlett Sher is a cause for celebration. It’s a work that reaffirms the popularity of dramatic art, that spreads the gospel of the straight play as a family affair. And that may also be why the announcement took the wind out of me. When this dreadful chapter ends, will we pick up where we left off? I feel for the actors and stage managers and dressers and stagehands deprived of a paycheck. And for the audiences for whom this vital night out has dropped off the calendar.</p>

    <h1>New York’s ‘patient zero’ breaks his silence after surviving covid-19</h1>
    
        <p>A New York man identified by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) as “patient zero” is still recovering from his frightening time battling covid-19, and he is speaking publicly for the first time about his experience.</p>
    
        <p>Lawrence Garbuz, 50, and his wife, Adina Garbuz, of New Rochelle, N.Y., thought he had pneumonia in February when he developed a cough and slight fever, the couple told NBC’s “Today” show.</p>
    
        <p>The novel coronavirus wasn’t on his mind as the country was mainly focused on people who had recently traveled internationally, he said. Lawrence Garbuz also had no other health conditions to prompt suspicion of the virus. New Rochelle’s outbreak would eventually be traced to him.</p>
    
        <p>The Garbuzes suspected he just needed medicine, but his condition worsened quickly, prompting a trip to the emergency room, where time seemed to stop for the practicing attorney.</p>
    
        <p>“After we entered the emergency room, I have absolutely no recollection of anything that transpired until I woke up from the coma,” he said. “So, it’s as if three weeks of my life had completely disappeared, and I was asleep for all of it.” </p>
    
        <p>Lawrence Garbuz was hospitalized Feb. 27 and diagnosed with the virus March 2. His wife and other members of their family also later tested positive for the virus.</p>

        <p>Adina Garbuz was in charge of her husband’s medical care, and while he was in a coma, she made the decision to have him transferred to a large hospital and intubated.</p>
    
        <p>“He was suffering and I couldn’t watch it,” she said. “I just didn’t think he was going to make an ambulance ride in that state.” </p>
    
        <p>Her choices saved his life, he said.</p>
    
        <p>Lawrence Garbuz stayed alone in a hospital room because of visiting restrictions. When he emerged from his coma, pictures of his four children motivated him to get better so he could return home, he said. The first thing he said to his wife was “I love you,” she told Guthrie, holding back tears.</p>
    
        <p>Lawrence Garbuz was able to leave the hospital in late March, according to Cuomo.</p>
    
        <p>When he did, the trust and estates law firm partner entered a different world where infections, restrictions and fear had quickly spread across the country. He missed much of the initial climb of cases in New York before it became the country’s epicenter for the virus.</p>
    
        <p>Being one of the first patients with covid-19 and having the sobriquet of “patient zero” hasn’t been a strong focus for Lawrence Garbuz. He has been trying to get better, but has not elaborated on how his health needs to improve.</p>
    
        <p>“I’m thankful that I’m alive, to be honest with you,” he said more than two months after being hospitalized. “It’s been quite a journey.” </p>

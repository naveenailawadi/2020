        <p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md">The stock market is for profits, not prophets.</p>
    
        <p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md">It’s been a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/06/08/stocks-market-today-nasdaq-economy/?itid=lk_inline_manual_3" target="_blank">great 10 weeks</a> for people who own U.S. stocks. The market rose about 45 percent in the 53 trading days from its March 23 low through Monday, adding almost 9,000 points to the Dow Jones industrial average and more than $11 trillion in value to the Wilshire 5000 Total Market Index.</p>
    
        <p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md">This enormous positive run has prompted cheerful predictions that the stock market is telling us that better days are near at hand, despite <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/coronavirus-us-cases-deaths/?itid=lk_inline_manual_5" target="_blank">more than 109,000 deaths</a> from the coronavirus pandemic; tens of millions of recently unemployed people, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/06/05/may-2020-jobs-report/?itid=lk_inline_manual_5" target="_blank">last month’s reported employment gain</a> notwithstanding; civil unrest in cities and towns throughout the country; and political and social divisiveness, which I suspect may be our country’s biggest problem of all.</p>
    
        <p class="font--body font-copy hide-for-print ma-0 mb-md interstitial italic"><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/06/05/may-2020-jobs-report-misclassification-error/?itid=lk_interstitial_manual_7">A ‘misclassification error’ made the May unemployment rate look better than it is. Here’s what happened.</a></p>
    
        <p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md">Now, to the main point. The stock market is supposed to be a predictive indicator, right? So if stocks are going up so much so quickly, isn’t the market trying to tell us something?</p>
    
        <p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md">Not necessarily. I’d love to join in the happy buzz, but I’m not at all sure about the market being an accurate predicting mechanism, either up or down.</p>
    
        <p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md">As the late, great and occasionally playful economist Paul Samuelson wrote in a 1966 Newsweek column, “Wall Street indexes predicted nine out of the last five recessions.”</p>
    
        <p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md">That being the case, there’s no reason to think that optimistic predictions based on rising markets are any more accurate than pessimistic predictions based on falling markets.</p>
    
        <p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md">In addition, we need to put things in context. Despite the big 53-day run, stocks are still down about $1.6 trillion, or 4.47 percent, since the pandemic began affecting the market, according to Wilshire Associates. The market is about where it started the year.</p>
    
        <p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md">And then there’s a math lesson from Dan Wiener of Adviser Investments. He points out that if the S&amp;P 500 were to keep rising at the rate of the past 53 trading days, it would post an annualized return of 472 percent (not counting reinvested dividends).</p>
    
        <p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md">Somehow, I don’t think that’s going to happen.</p>
    
        <p class="font--body font-copy hide-for-print ma-0 mb-md interstitial italic"><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/06/08/economy-recession-february/?itid=lk_interstitial_manual_18">U.S. economy officially went into a recession in February, ending record 128-month expansion</a></p>
    
        <p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md">Besides, if you think the market is a great predictor, it was telling us about 10 weeks ago — when the S&amp;P fell 34 percent in a bit over a month — that the end of the world was at hand.</p>
    
        <p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md">Which it wasn’t.</p>
    
        <p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md">Why are we seeing such extreme swings? I sure don’t think it’s because of changing perceptions on the part of investors.</p>
    
        <p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md">Rather, I think a lot of it has to do with momentum, where prices keep going up because they’re going up, or going down because they’re going down. Sure, that’s not what they teach in Markets 101. But I think it’s happening because trading volume these days consists largely of computers trading with one another, not people analyzing situations and making bets.</p>
    
        <p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md">In the short run, anything can happen. And these days, it frequently does.</p>
    
        <p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md">In the long run, stock prices are determined by interest rates and earnings. It’s hard to foresee interest rates lower than the ones we’ve got now, and I have no idea what corporate earnings are going to look like over the next few calendar quarters. And I don’t know if anyone knows.</p>
    
        <p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md">Look, I’ve got a lot of skin in this game, because most of my net worth is in stocks.</p>
    
        <p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md">So I’m a guy who wants to see stocks go up. And because I care about this country, I want to see Americans and the American economy do well.</p>
    
        <p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md">There’s an idea abroad in the land that Friday’s employment report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that showed employment unexpectedly rising in May means that everything looks great for the economic future.</p>
    
        <p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md">I wouldn’t be so sure, however. For starters, the unemployment rate would be 16.3 percent had the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/06/05/may-2020-jobs-report-misclassification-error/?itid=lk_inline_manual_31" target="_blank">BLS not had an error in its report</a>. That would be down from what would have been about 19.7 percent rather than the reported 14.7 percent.</p>
    
        <p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md">But there are still more than 20 million people unemployed.</p>
    
        <p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md">What’s more, the only reason unemployment fell and our economy hasn’t totally imploded is that Congress has thrown trillions of dollars at our economy to help businesses survive and stop people from having to file for bankruptcy en masse because they lost their jobs, had no income and little or no savings, and couldn’t pay their bills.</p>
    
        <p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md">The Federal Reserve, which has the power to create money, has thrown record amounts of cash at various parts of the securities markets to keep them afloat.</p>
    
        <p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md">But now — unfortunately, in my humble opinion — Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other Republicans, including President Trump, are talking about cutting back sharply on aid in the next stimulus package, which they seem in no hurry to pass.</p>
    
        <p class="font--body font-copy hide-for-print ma-0 mb-md interstitial italic"><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/06/06/workers-pay-cuts-coronavirus/?itid=lk_interstitial_manual_40">‘I don’t know if that counts as a job’: Fewer hours, less pay and more anxiety greet returning workers</a></p>
    
        <p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md">Given that the only thing keeping business and the economy afloat has been massive amounts of borrowed taxpayer money and Federal Reserve moves to try to stabilize financial markets, cutting back on the taxpayer money being shoveled into the economy could cause things to start sinking again.</p>
    
        <p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md">Things could get ugly — I mean, really ugly — if states, cities and school districts don’t get the financial aid they need to avoid massive layoffs.</p>
    
        <p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md">Not to mention what happens if the <a class="contextual_link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/02/28/what-you-need-know-about-coronavirus/?itid=lk_inline_manual_43" target="_blank">coronavirus</a> stages a comeback in the fall.</p>
    
        <p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md">I don’t know where stocks — and the economy — go from here. No one knows.</p>
    
        <p class="font--body font-copy hide-for-print ma-0 mb-md interstitial italic"><a href="https://wapo.st/virusletter">Stay safe and informed as the United States reopens with our free Coronavirus Updates newsletter</a></p>
    
        <p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md">The one thing I do know, however, is that stocks going down sharply (as they did from mid-February through late March) doesn’t necessarily mean the end of the world is at hand, and stocks rising sharply (as they have done since then) doesn’t necessarily mean that everything is good and getting better.</p>
    
        <p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md">It’s foolish — and dangerous — to let the stock market’s day-to-day moves drive public policy, which I’m afraid is the kind of thing that Trump (who takes credit for rising stock prices but no blame for falling stock prices) could well try to do. Just because the stock market has recovered most of its coronavirus-related losses doesn’t mean that our economy — and our people — have recovered.</p>
    
        <p class="font--body font-copy gray-darkest ma-0 pb-md">If you’re looking for profits, the stock market is the place to be. But if you’re looking for prophets, you’d best look elsewhere.</p>

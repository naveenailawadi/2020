        <img class="g-image-element-noscript" src="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2020/06/08/zoomy-robert-frank/assets/images/robert-frank-4000.jpg"/>
    
        <p class="g-body">Robert Frank chose this image for the cover of his eye-opening book of 83 photographs, “The Americans,” published in 1959. He had crossed America by car, seeing it as an outsider, a Swiss who left Zurich in 1947 in search of broader horizons.</p>
    
        <p class="g-body">What he found fascinated and disturbed him. Most horrifying was the ingrained racism. “That trip I got to like black people so much more than white people,” he told Nicholas Dawidoff in The New York Times Magazine in 2015.</p>
    
        <p class="g-body">“Trolley — New Orleans” is all about division. Two rows of windows, each window a frame.</p>
    
        <p class="g-body">This is the segregated South, in which African-American riders on public transportation were consigned to the “back of the bus.” The sequence from the front to the rear reads like a step-down hierarchy.</p>
    
        <p class="g-body">In the foremost seat is the only passenger obscured by pulled-down glass. The veiling of his spectacled face makes him a pale spectral presence. The decorative element that hovers above his head amplifies his mysterious power.</p>
    
        <p class="g-body">The woman behind him stares with pursed-lip disdain at the man snapping her picture</p>
    
        <p class="g-body">Notice, too, the arabesque W of the Walgreens drugstore logo behind her. It is like an insignia that ranks her as an officer in the governing establishment, placing her just below the man in front of her. Because that element over his head, by strange coincidence, features a similar but larger swoop.</p>
    
        <p class="g-body">Dead center we see the future — two white children, presumably brother and sister, with a dark presence looming in the background. Could it be their black nanny, who will take a seat in the “colored” section just behind them? New Orleans streetcars had movable barriers, to adjust to the racial make-up of the ridership at any time.</p>
    
        <p class="g-body">The portrait of the man gazing with infinite sadness out of slightly unfocused eyes is unforgettable.</p>
    
        <p class="g-body">And what about the woman in the last seat? Unlike the three before her, she is looking out sideways from the frame. Is she talking to someone on the street? Hard to know. What is clear, however, is that — seemingly alone among these riders — she is affable and engaged.</p>
    
        <p class="g-body">Each portrait tells its own story.</p>

        <img class="g-image-element-noscript" src="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2020/06/08/zoomy-robert-frank/assets/images/lange-4000.png"/>
    
        <p class="g-body">The white woman brings to mind the stern-faced dowager in a photograph taken by Dorothea Lange in 1938. But Lange’s woman, who seems arrogant, was in fact grieving; her limousine was taking her to a funeral.</p>
    
        <p class="g-body">The woman in Frank’s image is given no such excuse.</p>
    
        <img class="g-image-element g-freebird-lazy" data-pattern="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2020/06/08/zoomy-robert-frank/assets/images/sander-{{size}}.jpg" data-pattern-retina="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2020/06/08/zoomy-robert-frank/assets/images/sander-{{size}}_x2.jpg" data-ratio="1.4254777070063693" data-widths="[180,300,460,720,1050,1440,2000,2880,4000]" src="https://static01.nyt.com/packages/flash/multimedia/ICONS/transparent.png" width="180"/>
    
        <img class="g-image-element-noscript" src="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2020/06/08/zoomy-robert-frank/assets/images/sander-4000.jpg"/>
    
        <p class="g-body">The two well-dressed kids make me think of August Sander’s 1925 portrait of a very proper pair of siblings. In both sets of children, the boy looks stolidly assertive, the girl anxious. The child is father to the man — and girl the mother to the woman.</p>
    
        <img class="g-image-element g-freebird-lazy" data-pattern="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2020/06/08/zoomy-robert-frank/assets/images/sorrows-{{size}}.jpg" data-pattern-retina="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2020/06/08/zoomy-robert-frank/assets/images/sorrows-{{size}}_x2.jpg" data-ratio="1.286620835536753" data-widths="[180,300,460,720,1050,1440,2000,2880,4000]" src="https://static01.nyt.com/packages/flash/multimedia/ICONS/transparent.png" width="180"/>
    
        <img class="g-image-element-noscript" src="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2020/06/08/zoomy-robert-frank/assets/images/sorrows-4000.jpg"/>
    
        <p class="g-body">The man in the window resembles Our Man of Sorrows, the suffering face of Jesus Christ after he has been scourged and awaits crucifixion — a popular subject for Western artists during the Renaissance.</p>
    
        <img class="g-image-element g-freebird-lazy" data-pattern="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2020/06/08/zoomy-robert-frank/assets/images/robert-frank-{{size}}.jpg" data-pattern-retina="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2020/06/08/zoomy-robert-frank/assets/images/robert-frank-{{size}}_x2.jpg" data-ratio="0.6263473053892216" data-widths="[180,300,460,720,1050,1440,2000,2880,4000]" src="https://static01.nyt.com/packages/flash/multimedia/ICONS/transparent.png" width="180"/>
    
        <img class="g-image-element-noscript" src="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2020/06/08/zoomy-robert-frank/assets/images/robert-frank-4000.jpg"/>
    
        <p class="g-body">That the four bright white buttons on the man’s shirt form the pattern of the cross is one of those divinely ordained accidents.</p>
    
        <p class="g-body">But the portraits are only one piece of the picture. In this photograph, which is as stately as a frieze on a Greek temple entablature, there is more going on.</p>
    
        <p class="g-body">The grid that dominates the image is about to become a predominant element of contemporary art. Looked at purely in formal terms, “Trolley — New Orleans” is laying down a grid and filling in the boxes, a hallmark of the Minimalist art that would blossom in the ’60s.</p>
    
        <p class="g-body">Parts of this photograph are intensely painterly.</p>
    
        <p class="g-body">Particularly the reflections in the closed windows on the upper level of the streetcar, which morph into abstractions.</p>
    
        <img class="g-image-element g-freebird-lazy" data-pattern="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2020/06/08/zoomy-robert-frank/assets/images/whistler-{{size}}.jpg" data-pattern-retina="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2020/06/08/zoomy-robert-frank/assets/images/whistler-{{size}}_x2.jpg" data-ratio="1.522257053291536" data-widths="[180,300,460,720,1050,1440,2000,2880,4000]" src="https://static01.nyt.com/packages/flash/multimedia/ICONS/transparent.png" width="180"/>

        <p class="g-body">The window in the center, with its tracery of beaded lights and dark shapes on a watery surface, could easily be a Whistler painting — say, “Nocturne in Blue and Gold: Valparaiso Bay.”<a href="https://www.whistlerpaintings.gla.ac.uk/catalogue/image/?imageid=y076_001&amp;xml=dat&amp;nid=&amp;mid=y076"> </a></p>

        <p class="g-body">The two on the right-hand side seem more modern, like something out of Abstract Expressionism.</p>
    
        <img class="g-image-element g-freebird-lazy" data-pattern="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2020/06/08/zoomy-robert-frank/assets/images/krasner-{{size}}.jpg" data-pattern-retina="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2020/06/08/zoomy-robert-frank/assets/images/krasner-{{size}}_x2.jpg" data-ratio="0.7612380250552689" data-widths="[180,300,460,720,1050,1440,2000,2880,4000]" src="https://static01.nyt.com/packages/flash/multimedia/ICONS/transparent.png" width="180"/>

        <p class="g-body">Such as Lee Krasner’s 1969 lithograph “Primary Series: Blue Stone.”<a href="https://www.worldhouseeditions.com/node/173"> </a></p>
    
        <img class="g-image-element g-freebird-lazy" data-pattern="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2020/06/08/zoomy-robert-frank/assets/images/robert-frank-{{size}}.jpg" data-pattern-retina="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2020/06/08/zoomy-robert-frank/assets/images/robert-frank-{{size}}_x2.jpg" data-ratio="0.6263473053892216" data-widths="[180,300,460,720,1050,1440,2000,2880,4000]" src="https://static01.nyt.com/packages/flash/multimedia/ICONS/transparent.png" width="180"/>

        <p class="g-body">Even the lower parts of the photograph — its geometric pattern of the bolts, the evocative shapes of discolored metal, washed with light — suggest an abstract composition.</p>
    
        <img class="g-image-element g-freebird-lazy" data-pattern="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2020/06/08/zoomy-robert-frank/assets/images/stieglitz-{{size}}.jpg" data-pattern-retina="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2020/06/08/zoomy-robert-frank/assets/images/stieglitz-{{size}}_x2.jpg" data-ratio="1.25390625" data-widths="[180,300,460,720,1050,1440,2000,2880,4000]" src="https://static01.nyt.com/packages/flash/multimedia/ICONS/transparent.png" width="180"/>

        <p class="g-body">Typically, a great photograph with this many discrete parts has a focal point, around which everything rotates, as on a pinwheel. A celebrated example of that organizing principle is a small feature that animates Alfred Stieglitz’s 1907 photograph “The Steerage.”<a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/the-steerage/igGYpGdjRhdjog?hl=en&amp;ms=%7B%22x%22%3A0.5%2C%22y%22%3A0.5%2C%22z%22%3A8.170585162828225%2C%22size%22%3A%7B%22width%22%3A3.062981578472025%2C%22height%22%3A1.2375051388046903%7D%7D"> </a></p>
    
        <p class="g-body">The brightly lit boater hat of the gentleman above deck, high and center in the image, is the clear eye in the surrounding storm of commotion.</p>
    
        <img class="g-image-element g-freebird-lazy" data-pattern="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2020/06/08/zoomy-robert-frank/assets/images/robert-frank-{{size}}.jpg" data-pattern-retina="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2020/06/08/zoomy-robert-frank/assets/images/robert-frank-{{size}}_x2.jpg" data-ratio="0.6263473053892216" data-widths="[180,300,460,720,1050,1440,2000,2880,4000]" src="https://static01.nyt.com/packages/flash/multimedia/ICONS/transparent.png" width="180"/>

        <p class="g-body">In “Trolley — New Orleans,” your eye comes to rest on two sets of hands.</p>
    
        <p class="g-body">One pair belongs to the young white boy, who grasps the mullion with the entitled assurance of someone who knows his birthright.</p>
    
        <p class="g-body">If the mullion resembles a pillar, how right that is, because this boy is on his way to becoming a pillar of the establishment.</p>
    
        <p class="g-body">Near him in the next window frame — but infinitely removed — is the black laborer. One of his hands is hidden. The other rests loosely on the edge. He is thoroughly exhausted.</p>
    
        <p class="g-body">There is nothing here for him to hold onto.</p>
